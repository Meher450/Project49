            <p><i> Intersting Facts About Chameleon</i></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.<br></li>
                <li>Chameleons’ eyesight has developed both to help them catch prey and, as we’ve seen, to help them escape predators. They can focus their eyes relatively well, meaning they can judge distances and spot prey between 5 and 10 metres.<br></li>
                <li>They can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!<br></li>
                <li>The largest chameleon by length is the Malagasy giant chameleon, also known as Oustalets’s Chameleon. Some members of this species have been measured at almost 70cm, and are one of the species endemic to Madagascar (meaning they don’t naturally live anywhere else).<br></li>

                <p><i> Intersting Facts About Flying-Cicada</i></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging. <br></li>
                    <li>The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. (Females make a much quieter sound by flicking their wings.) Cicadas don’t sing at night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.<br></li>
                    <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.<br></li>
                    <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools. <br></li>
